# Slot-Game-Project1
This is my first independent project. This project is called Slot game, in which user gets to place bets on a matrix type alphabets generated randomly. Winning a bets will be awarded according to the vale and frequency of occurrence of the alphabets. The project is created entirely based on Vanilla Javascript.
